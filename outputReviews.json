        "comments": "Bavarian Biernope...I had such high hopes for visiting this place. I had reviewed the menu before going and hoped they had even a little of the good German taste I grew up on with the German Sausage Festivals with the German Communities back home.  Sadly, I was seriously disappointed.The interior of the establishment is ok for a German/Bavarian Beer Hall. It is a bit more modern than the old world style I would expect from the exterior theming and the costuming of the staff, but it is light and comfortable for the most part.  The benches are a bit narrow, but that is ok.  The menus are straight forward and easy to order from, the selections fairly simple and not a lot to it. It's about what one would expect, and a one page menu does well here.To start, my friend and I ordered a giant pretzel with beer cheese.  The pretzel was indeed massive and more than enough for two hungry folks. The cheese however was lackluster, but the mustard that came with it was awesome. Kind of sweet, and fantastic with the good and soft pretzel.My friend ordered the Kasespatzel.  She said it was a safe choice and was ok.  She ate about half of it and got the rest to go.  She also ordered the beer cheese soup and also said it was good.  Her favorite dish however was the potato salad.I ordered the Bierhaus Wursteller.  I won't ever do that again.  I had high hopes and we both wanted to try the various sausages, plus the sides sounded good.  We were wrong.  We both tried all of the sides and the sausages and agree... the sides, all of them, were bland and almost flavorless.  The potato dumpling and bread dumpling were both cold and looked to have been scooped with an ice cream scoop. The potato dumpling was almost gelatinous in texture and congealed.  The red cabbage was bland, and the sauerkraut was terrible. A good sauerkraut is strong and bold... this was the complete opposite and I was afraid I was eating coleslaw instead.  Then there was what was passed off as sausages.  While they weren't so terrible as to inedible, I have honestly, no joking around, had better sausage from Jimmy Dean and cooked in the microwave.  There is no way one could say this was anywhere near authentic.  I know it was at least cooked in a grill since two of them were heavily charred almost to the point of burnt, but the taste was nowhere near my expectations or hopes.  For the most expensive dish on the menu... epic fail.We both ordered desserts hoping they would be the highlight of the meal.  To that end my friend ordered the Pretzel Pudding and I got the Strawberry Tort.  She indicated the Pretzel Pudding was good.  The Tort meringue was entirely too sweet and too hard. Though the strawberries were delicious.If, and that is a strong if, I ever come back, I am doing nothing but a beer flight or two and praying the beer is better than the food.  After spending almost $100 this evening for dinner, I feel we'd have gotten far better food from McDonalds, and I freaking hate McDonalds.  I'll give it two stars being generous because the staff was nice and courteous, but the food was terrible.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My nephew and I decided to try it and ordered the reuben and fish and chips. The reuben ($11) was very good and came with regular fries. The fish and chips came with steak fries which we did not like as much as the regular fries. I love fish but probably would not order this dish again. It was $15 and came with one piece of fish and a lot of steak fries. The fish was ok. Jennifer was our server and we found her to be very nice. We were told the restaurant opened last Wednesday. Unless you park in the side of the mall you probably would not know the restaurant was there. One suggestion I would make is to have better signage in the mall. The doors leading to the restaurant are just plan exit doors that the general public would not use anyway.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

They've really done a great job re-creating an authentic German beer Hall. Lots of space for for big groups.

THE VOLUME WAS ABSOLUTELY OBNOXIOUS. I COULDN'T EVEN THINK MUCH LESS ENJOY THE COMPANY OF THE PEOPLE I WAS WITH. THE ACOUSTICS OF THE MAIN  AREA DO NOT WORK FOR SUCH LEVELS. ESPECIALLY THE DRUMMING (the all caps reflects how I felt the whole time). Honestly only posting this to help the staff and the business because they're right on track to be amazing! My party of 14 was very close to leaving and not ordering food because of the sound levels alone. Turning it down will prevent this.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",

My nephew and I decided to try it and ordered the reuben and fish and chips. The reuben ($11) was very good and came with regular fries. The fish and chips came with steak fries which we did not like as much as the regular fries. I love fish but probably would not order this dish again. It was $15 and came with one piece of fish and a lot of steak fries. The fish was ok. Jennifer was our server and we found her to be very nice. We were told the restaurant opened last Wednesday. Unless you park in the side of the mall you probably would not know the restaurant was there. One suggestion I would make is to have better signage in the mall. The doors leading to the restaurant are just plan exit doors that the general public would not use anyway.\n        Was this review …?\n    ",
